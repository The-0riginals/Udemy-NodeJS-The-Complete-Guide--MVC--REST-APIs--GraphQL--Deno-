//-----------------------------------------
//important note:
As of Sep 2022 Mailtrap's Sending API cannot be used to send e-mails to your Mailtrap Sandbox.  It can only be used to send real/production e-mails, to real users.
Please check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73734572/mailtrap-api-cannot-send-emails-unauthorized-api-error. I get the unauthorized error as well when trying to send an email.

//-----------------------------------------
//update: Update: Problem solved:



Here is the solution to use directly nodemailer with Gmail. No Sendgrip BS. No Mailtrap junk. Nope. Using Nodemailer directly.





After getting that Gmail App Password, then we can use it this way:



const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
        pass: 'Your16CharsLongAppPass',
    }
});


transporter.sendMail({
    to: email,
    from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
    subject: 'Signup succeeded',
    html: '<h1>You successfully signed up!</h1>'
}).catch(error => {
    console.log('error = ', error, '\n');
});


It works.
