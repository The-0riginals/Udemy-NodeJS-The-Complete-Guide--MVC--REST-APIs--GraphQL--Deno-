// i'm not sure how to use those code above, so i just follow the instruction as in lecture
1. install mongodb for vs code: npm install mongodb

2 in database.js, add the following code:

const mongodb = require('mongodb');
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;

let _db;

const mongoConnect = (callback) => {
    MongoClient.connect("mongodb+srv://Klaus:19001009@cluster0.lw7vbw4.mongodb.net/") // klaus is the username, 19001009 is the password, change to your own
        .then(client => {
            console.log('Connected!');
            _db = client.db();
            callback();
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.log(err);
            throw err;
        });
}

const getDb = () => {
    if (_db) {
        return _db;
    }
    throw 'No database found!';
}

exports.mongoConnect = mongoConnect;
exports.getDb = getDb;

3. in app.js, add the following code:

const mongoConnect = require('./util/database').mongoConnect;

mongoConnect(() => {
    app.listen(3000);
});

=> it works!

//When trying to run nodejs with --watch on Windows, sometimes its built-in filesystem watcher crashes silently, 
*) solution:
=> in package.json, change the code to: "start": "node app.js" instead of "start": "node --watch app.js"
=> it seems unconvenient, but it works! and "--watch" next time to try your luck cuz it just crashes sometimes
